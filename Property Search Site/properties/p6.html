      From the outside this house looks grandiose. It has been built with white stones and has tan stone decorations. Tall, squared windows brighten up the house and have been added to the house in a fairly asymmetrical pattern.
      
      The house is equipped with a large kitchen and one large bathroom, it also has a huge living room, three bedrooms, a large dining area, a sun room and a small storage room.
      
      The building is shaped like a squared S. The two extensions extend into glass overhanging panels circling around half the house.
      The second floor is smaller than the first, which, in combination with its placement, creates an original look. This floor has a very different style than the floor below.
      
      The roof is high and square shaped and is covered with slate shingles. Two small chimneys poke out the center of the roof. Several large windows let in plenty of light to the rooms below the roof.
      The house itself is surrounded by a modest garden, with mostly grass, a few flower patches and a children's playground.
      The property is conveniently located within easy access of Streatham station, providing excellent links into Central London and also close to an array of bus routes, shops, bars, restaurants, cafes and amenities on the high road. Both Tooting Bec (with popular Lido) and Streatham Common are close-by offering a pleasant open space away from the bustle of this excellent central location. </p>
